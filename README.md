## Deployment

This project is pre-configured for automated deployment on **Render** (as indicated by your secrets script) and **Vercel**.

### Deploying to Render (Full Stack)
1.  **Generate Secrets**: Run `python generate_secrets.py` locally and save the output.
2.  **Create Blueprint**: Go to the Render Dashboard, click **New > Blueprint**, and connect this repository.
3.  **Automatic Provisioning**: Render will detect `render.yaml` and automatically set up the static frontend, the Python backend, and the PostgreSQL database.
4.  **Configuration**: Use the secrets generated in step 1 to fill in the required environment variables in the Render dashboard.

### Deploying to Vercel (Frontend Only)
1.  Connect your repository to Vercel.
2.  Vercel will automatically detect the **Vite** framework and configure the build settings.
3.  Set the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable in the Vercel dashboard to point to your live backend API.
